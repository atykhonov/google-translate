;;; Commentary:

;; This file is the core of `google-translate' package. It does contains
;; the most important and vital functions and variables for the
;; package functionality.
;;
;; The most important is the `google-translate-request' function which
;; is intended to be used by other scripts and packages, expecially by
;; the packages which provides UI. 
;;
;; This, `google-translate-core', package doesn't provide any UI.
;;
;; `google-translate-request' function sends http request to the
;; google service and returns JSON response which contains translation
;; and other info.
;;
;; There are also a set of helper functions which are going to be
;; useful to retrieve data from the mentioned JSON response:
;;
;; `google-translate-json-text-phonetic' - retrieves text phonetic; 
;;
;; `google-translate-json-translation' - retrieves translation;
;;
;; `google-translate-json-translation-phonetic' - retrieves
;; phonetic translation;
;;
;; `google-translate-json-detailed-translation' - retrieves
;; additional, detailed information which relates to the
;; translation.
